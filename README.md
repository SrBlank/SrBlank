# Saad Rafiq - Aspiring Software Engineer

### About Me
🎓 Set to graduate in December 2024 from Texas State University, currently I’m a Senior double majoring in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics.

🌟 Actively seeking Software Internships for Summer 2024 to leverage my experience and contribute innovative solutions.

💻 I am proficient in C/C++, Java, and Python, with a strong background in both theoretical understanding and practical application

🔬 Engaged in cutting-edge research focused on enhancing autonomous firefighting capabilities. I’m pioneering methods using drones for data collection on burning buildings to inform safer and more effective firefighting strategies.

🤝 Open to connecting and exploring opportunities where I can contribute and grow as a part of a dynamic team, working at the intersection of technology and real-world problem-solving.

I currently do research at the High-Performance Engineering Lab, researching autonomous data collection on burning buildings using drones for firefighters. My current passion project is [RPI-Alarm](https://github.com/SrBlank/RPI-Alarm), which is an alarm clock web app meant to be ran on a system that is connected to speakers to ensure you wake up!
