# Saad Rafiq 
*Software Engineer - Robotics & Autonomous Systems - Applied Mathematics*

### About Me
I'm a Software Engineer I at Dell Technologies with a strong background in computer science, applied mathematics, and robotics. I graduated from Texas State University (Dec 2024) with a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Applied Mathematics.

My interests are in software engineering and autonomy, particularly robotics, drones, and intelligent infrastructure. I enjoy working closely with hardware and embedded systems, and I’m equally comfortable building full-stack applications, tooling, and large-scale automation.

I'm especially passionate about: 
- Autonomous drones and robots
- Applied ML & computer vision
- Embedded systems
- Turning research prototypes into production ready software
