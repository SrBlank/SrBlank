# Saad Rafiq - Aspiring Software Engineer

### About Me
Hello and welcome to my GitHub page! My name is Saad Rafiq, I am in my third year at Texas State University, double majoring in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. 

I currently do research at the High-Performance Engineering Lab, researching autonomous data collection on burning buildings using drones for firefighters. My current passion project is [RPI-Alarm](https://github.com/SrBlank/RPI-Alarm), which is an alarm clock web-app meant to be ran on a system which is connected to speakers to ensure you wake up! 

Check out my portfolio at [rafiqsaad.com](https://rafiqsaad.com) to see my experiences and contact info. Please reach out to me regarding the code I have worked on, research/mentorship questions, resume, experiences, or whatever else!
